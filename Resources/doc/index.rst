Securing Method Invocations
===========================

This bundle allows you to secure method invocations on your service layer with
annotations.

Generally, you can secure all public, or protected methods which are non-static,
and non-final. Private methods cannot be secured this way.

Annotations can also be declared on parent classes, or interfaces. In cases of
conflicting annotations, the annotation that is declared on a class which ranks
lower in the inheritance tree has precedence.

@SecureMethod
-------------
This annotation lets you define who (``Token``) is allowed to invoke a method::

    <?php
    
    class MyService
    {
        /**
         * @SecureMethod(roles="ROLE_USER, ROLE_FOO, ROLE_ADMIN")
         */
        public function secureMethod() 
        {
            // ...
        }
    }

@SecureParam
------------
This annotation lets you define restrictions for parameters which are passed to
the method. This is only useful if the parameters are domain objects::

    <?php
    
    class MyService
    {
        /**
         * @SecureParam(name="comment", permissions="EDIT, DELETE")
         * @SecureParam(name="post", permissions="OWNER")
         */
        public function secureMethod($comment, $post)
        {
            // ...
        }
    }

@SecureReturn
-------------
This annotation lets you define restrictions for the value which is returned by
the method. This is also only useful if the returned value is a domain object::

    <?php
    
    class MyService
    {
        /**
         * @SecureReturn(permissions="VIEW")
         */
        public function secureMethod()
        {
            // ...
            
            return $domainObject;
        }
    }
